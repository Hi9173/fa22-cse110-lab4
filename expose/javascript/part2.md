1. Line 12 will print the number 3, as the for loop runs 3 times and 'i' is being increatmened 4 times. At i = 0, the first number in the vector, 100, is being discounted. At i = 1, 200 is being discounted. At i = 2, 300 is being discounted. Then after the third loop is done, i is incremented to be 3, which is equal to th elength of the input vector, 3, instead of less than, thus the loop stops and i = 3.
